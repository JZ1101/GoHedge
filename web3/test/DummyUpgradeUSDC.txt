=============================================================================

CONTRACT OVERVIEW:
------------------
DummyUpgradeUSDC is an enhanced decentralized insurance protocol smart contract 
that extends the original DummyUpgrade functionality with full USDC token support

(AVAX native and USDC ERC-20).

CORE FEATURES:
--------------
1. Dual reserve system (AVAX + USDC support)
2. ERC-20 token integration with SafeERC20
3. Chainlink Time-based Automation (Time-based only)
4. Multi-token price monitoring (AVAX, BTC, ETH, USDC)
5. Automated and manual payout mechanisms
6. Enhanced emergency controls for both token types
7. Gas-optimized batch processing
8. USDC-specific balance tracking
9. Mixed token payout handling
10. Advanced reserve withdrawal system

--------------------------
1. USDC Token Integration:
   - IERC20 interface with SafeERC20 utilities
   - 6-decimal precision handling
   - Approval-based transfers
   - Balance tracking for both AVAX and USDC

2. Dual Reserve System:
   - isUSDCReserve boolean flag per contract
   - AVAX reserves: Traditional native token handling
   - USDC reserves: ERC-20 token handling with approvals
   - Independent withdrawal mechanisms

3. Enhanced Contract Structure:
   - Additional isUSDCReserve field
   - Reserve amount handles both token types
   - Fee payments always in AVAX (simplified)

-------------------------------
Token Contract Integration:
- IERC20 interface with SafeERC20 for secure transfers
- Immutable USDC token address set in constructor
- 6-decimal precision handling throughout
- Approval-based transfer workflow

Reserve Creation Workflow:
1. AVAX Reserves:
   - Call createContract() with isUSDCReserve = false
   - Send AVAX via msg.value for reserve amount
   - No token approvals required

2. USDC Reserves:
   - Approve USDC spending: usdcToken.approve(contract, amount)
   - Call createContract() with isUSDCReserve = true
   - No AVAX needed in msg.value
   - Contract transfers USDC using safeTransferFrom()

Payout Execution Logic:
```solidity
function _executePayout(Contract storage c) internal {
    if (c.isUSDCReserve) {
        // USDC payout with 6-decimal precision
        usdcToken.safeTransfer(c.beneficiary, c.reserveAmount);
    } else {
        // AVAX payout in wei
        payable(c.beneficiary).transfer(c.reserveAmount);
    }
}
