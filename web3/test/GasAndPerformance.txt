   - Configurable maxContractsPerCheck
   - Dynamic termination based on remaining gas

PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED:
==================================

Primary Bottlenecks (Time-Based):
---------------------------------
1. Price Feed Calls:
   - Multiple getCurrentPrice() calls in batch
   - Each call: ~5,000-10,000 gas
   - Mitigation: Price feed caching (future enhancement)

2. Contract State Updates:
   - Multiple triggered contract state changes
   - Each update: ~20,000-30,000 gas
   - Mitigation: Batch state updates where possible

3. Gas Limit Constraints:
   - Chainlink 2.5M gas limit restricts batch sizes
   - Large contract pools require multiple cycles
   - Mitigation: Optimal batch sizing (15-20 contracts)

Secondary Considerations:
------------------------
1. Time Interval Frequency:
   - Very frequent checks increase costs
   - Infrequent checks may miss opportunities
   - Mitigation: 1-hour interval balances cost and responsiveness

2. Contract Pool Growth:
   - Linear increase in checking overhead
   - Large pools (1000+) require optimization
   - Mitigation: Contract archival and pruning strategies
