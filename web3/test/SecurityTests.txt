                      SECURITY TESTS DOCUMENTATION
=============================================================================

TEST OVERVIEW:
--------------
Comprehensive security testing suite for the GoHedge DummyUpgrade smart contract
focusing on critical vulnerabilities including reentrancy attacks, access control,
input validation, state corruption, and edge case protection.

SECURITY FRAMEWORK:
------------------
Framework: Mocha + Chai + Hardhat
Security Focus: Reentrancy, Access Control, Input Validation
Tools: MaliciousContract.sol for attack simulation
Network: Hardhat Local with account impersonation
Coverage: 6 major security categories, 20+ test cases

TEST CATEGORIES:
===============

1. REENTRANCY PROTECTION TESTS:
-------------------------------
Purpose: Validate protection against reentrancy attacks on fund transfer functions

Should prevent reentrancy attacks on claimPayout
  - Creates insurance contract with 1 ETH reserve
  - Malicious contract purchases insurance for 0.1 ETH
  - Triggers payout condition (AVAX price drops below 15 USD)
  - Attempts reentrancy attack via malicious receive() function
  - Verifies only single payout occurs (1 ETH, not multiple)
  - Uses account impersonation for legitimate claim testing
  - Expected Result: Attack fails, legitimate claim succeeds

Should prevent reentrancy on withdrawReserve
  - Malicious contract creates insurance contract as seller
  - Waits for contract expiration (past end date)
  - Attempts reentrancy attack on withdrawReserve function
  - Verifies reentrancy protection prevents multiple withdrawals
  - Tracks reentry attempt count (should be limited)
  - Expected Result: Multiple withdrawal attempts blocked

Should handle legitimate multiple transactions
  - Creates 3 separate insurance contracts normally
  - Each contract purchased by legitimate buyer
  - All contracts triggered simultaneously
  - All payouts claimed through normal process
  - Verifies no interference between legitimate operations
  - Expected Result: All legitimate transactions succeed

2. ACCESS CONTROL TESTS:
-----------------------
Purpose: Ensure only authorized users can execute privileged functions

Should prevent unauthorized automation configuration
  - Non-owner attempts to call configureAutomation()
  - Expected Result: "Ownable: caller is not the owner" revert

Should prevent unauthorized price feed additions
  - Non-owner attempts to call addPriceFeed()
  - Expected Result: "Ownable: caller is not the owner" revert

Should prevent unauthorized test mode changes
  - Non-owner attempts to call setTestMode()
  - Expected Result: "Ownable: caller is not the owner" revert

Should prevent unauthorized test price setting
  - Non-owner attempts to call setTestPrice()
  - Expected Result: "Ownable: caller is not the owner" revert

3. INPUT VALIDATION TESTS:
-------------------------
Purpose: Verify contract handles invalid inputs gracefully

Should validate price feed addresses
  - Attempts to add price feed with zero address
  - Expected Result: "Invalid feed address" revert

Should handle extremely large values
  - Creates contract with very large trigger price (1M ETH)
  - Tests system behavior with edge case values
  - Expected Result: Contract handles large values correctly

Should reject invalid contract parameters
  - Tests zero trigger price rejection
  - Tests invalid date ranges (end before start)
  - Tests insufficient reserve scenarios
  - Expected Results: Appropriate error messages for each case

Should handle empty and invalid string tokens
  - Tests contract creation with empty token strings
  - Verifies system accepts or rejects appropriately
  - Expected Result: Graceful handling of edge cases

Should validate date ranges properly
  - Tests various invalid date combinations
  - Verifies start date vs end date validation
  - Expected Result: "Invalid date range" for invalid combinations

4. STATE CORRUPTION PROTECTION TESTS:
------------------------------------
Purpose: Ensure contract state remains consistent after failed operations

Should maintain consistent state after failed operations
  - Creates valid contract successfully
  - Attempts invalid contract creation (should fail)
  - Verifies contract counter remains unchanged after failure
  - Expected Result: State consistency maintained

Should handle rapid state changes
  - Creates contract and purchases insurance
  - Performs rapid price updates in succession
  - Verifies contract state remains valid throughout
  - Expected Result: State remains consistent despite rapid changes

5. EDGE CASE PROTECTION TESTS:
-----------------------------
Purpose: Test behavior under unusual or extreme conditions

Should handle contract interactions with insufficient funds
  - Deploys contract with zero ETH balance
  - Attempts contract creation without sufficient funds
  - Expected Result: Transaction fails with funds-related error

Should handle simultaneous operations on same contract
  - One buyer purchases insurance successfully
  - Second buyer attempts purchase on same contract
  - Expected Result: "Already purchased" revert

Should handle contract with zero value transactions
  - Attempts contract creation with zero ETH sent
  - Expected Result: "Insufficient reserve sent" revert

Should handle extremely small values
  - Creates contract with 1 wei amounts
  - Tests system behavior with minimal values
  - Expected Result: Contract handles micro-transactions

6. COMPREHENSIVE REENTRANCY TESTS:
---------------------------------
Purpose: Advanced reentrancy testing with multiple contracts

Should prevent complex reentrancy scenarios
  - Creates 3 contracts with 0.5 ETH reserves each
  - Malicious contract purchases all 3 insurances
  - Triggers all payouts simultaneously
  - Attempts reentrancy attacks on all contracts
  - Uses impersonation for legitimate claims when attacks fail
  - Verifies total payout equals exactly 1.5 ETH (3 Ã— 0.5 ETH)
  - Expected Results:
    * 3 reentrancy attempts (all should fail)
    * 3 successful legitimate claims (via impersonation)
    * Total payout: 1.5 ETH exactly

7. BALANCE VERIFICATION TESTS:
-----------------------------
Purpose: Ensure accurate balance tracking throughout contract lifecycle

Should maintain accurate balance tracking
  - Tracks contract balance at each stage:
    * Initial: 0 ETH
    * After creation: +1 ETH (reserve)
    * After purchase: +0.1 ETH (insurance fee) [may vary by implementation]
    * After claim: -1 ETH (payout)
  - Verifies exact balance changes match expected amounts
  - Expected Result: Balance tracking accuracy maintained

ATTACK SIMULATION SETUP:
========================

MaliciousContract.sol Requirements:
----------------------------------
- purchaseInsurance() function for normal purchases
- createContract() function for contract creation
- attemptReentrancy() function for claim attacks
- attemptWithdrawReentrancy() function for withdrawal attacks
- claimNormally() function for legitimate claims
- resetState() function for test cleanup
- receive() function for reentrancy attack execution
- reentryCount tracking for attempt monitoring

Test Account Setup:
------------------
- owner: Contract owner with administrative privileges
- attacker: Malicious user attempting attacks
- victim: Legitimate user creating contracts
- maliciousContract: Smart contract simulating attacks

Common Test Failures & Solutions:
=================================

1. "Transaction reverted without a reason string"
   - Cause: MaliciousContract missing functions
   - Solution: Implement complete MaliciousContract.sol

2. "contract runner does not support sending transactions"
   - Cause: Improper signer setup for contract interactions
   - Solution: Use account impersonation for contract-to-contract calls

3. "expected X to equal Y" (balance mismatches)
   - Cause: Fee handling differences in implementation
   - Solution: Adjust expectations based on actual contract behavior

4. Missing reentrancy attempts
   - Cause: Attack attempts not reaching receive() function
   - Solution: Ensure MaliciousContract properly triggers callbacks

ATTACK VECTORS TESTED:
=====================

1. Single Contract Reentrancy:
   - Attack: Multiple claims on same contract
   - Protection: claimed flag + ReentrancyGuard
   - Result: Only one payout executed

2. Cross-Contract Reentrancy:
   - Attack: Attack multiple contracts in sequence
   - Protection: Global reentrancy protection
   - Result: All attacks prevented

3. Withdrawal Reentrancy:
   - Attack: Multiple withdrawals of reserves
   - Protection: State updates before transfers
   - Result: Single withdrawal only

4. Complex Scenario Attacks:
   - Attack: Sophisticated multi-step attacks
   - Protection: Comprehensive security measures
   - Result: All attack vectors blocked

SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================

1. Immediate (Critical):
