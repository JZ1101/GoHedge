- Mapping-based storage: contractWhitelists[contractId][buyer] = bool
- Event-driven updates: All modifications emit appropriate events
- Access control: Seller-only whitelist management

Whitelist Management Workflow:
1. Contract Creation:
   - Set whitelistEnabled flag during createContract()
   - Initialize empty whitelist mapping
   - Emit ContractCreated with whitelist status

2. Whitelist Population:
   - Seller calls addBuyerToWhitelist() or batchAddBuyersToWhitelist()
   - Validate seller permissions and whitelist status
   - Update mapping and emit events

3. Purchase Validation:
   - Check whitelistEnabled flag in purchaseInsurance()
   - If enabled, validate buyer address in whitelist mapping
   - Proceed with purchase if validated or revert if not

4. Dynamic Management:
   - Allow status changes via setContractWhitelistStatus()
   - Prevent changes after first purchase (immutable)
   - Support add/remove operations throughout lifecycle

Event Enhancements for Whitelist:
- BuyerAddedToWhitelist(contractId, buyer, seller)
- BuyerRemovedFromWhitelist(contractId, buyer, seller)
- BatchWhitelistUpdate(contractId, added, removed, seller)
- Enhanced ContractCreated with whitelistEnabled parameter

Query Function Optimizations:
function getContractWhitelistedBuyers(
    uint256 _contractId,
    uint256 _offset,
    uint256 _limit
) external view returns (address[] memory buyers, bool hasMore)

function getContractWhitelistStats(
    uint256 _contractId
) external view returns (
    uint256 totalWhitelisted,
    bool whitelistEnabled,
    address contractSeller
)

Gas Optimization Strategies:
1. Batch Operations: Single transaction for multiple whitelist modifications
2. Mapping Storage: Efficient O(1) lookup for whitelist validation
3. Event Batching: Single event for batch operations with counters
4. Pagination: Limit query results to prevent gas limit issues
5. State Checks: Early validation to prevent unnecessary computations

Security Enhancements:
1. Seller-Only Access: Whitelist modifications restricted to contract seller
2. Status Immutability: Prevent whitelist changes after purchase activation
3. Input Validation: Comprehensive parameter checking for all functions
4. Event Auditing: Complete audit trail for all whitelist operations
5. Access Control: Consistent permission checking across all operations
