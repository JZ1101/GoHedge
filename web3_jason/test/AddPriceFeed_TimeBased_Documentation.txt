3. Cross-token insurance contract creation with varying parameters
4. Scheduled multi-token automated triggering system
5. Hourly interval-based automation execution
6. Time-based price feed integration and validation
7. Mixed trigger condition handling in time-based mode
8. Time interval configuration and management
